# foodiy
A web app that aims to solve the common problems of online recipe websites. We aim to make the experience of **actually cooking** with the app a smoother one, with clutter-free and easy-to-view recipes.

## Developing
To run the app locally, simply install Docker and run the command `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`. This should spin up the website on `http://localhost:3000`. You'll need a bunch of environment variables to get the app working, so just contact a team member for defaults.
